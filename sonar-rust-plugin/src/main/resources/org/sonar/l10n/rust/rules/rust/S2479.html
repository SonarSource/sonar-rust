<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>String literals containing invisible Unicode characters can lead to code that is difficult to read, debug, and maintain. These characters are not
visually apparent, which can cause confusion for developers trying to understand the code. Ensuring that string literals are free of invisible
characters improves code clarity and reduces the risk of unintended behavior.</p>
