This SonarSource project is a code analyzer for Rust projects to help developers write [Clean Code](https://www.sonarsource.com/solutions/clean-code).

## Features

- 50+ rules
- Metrics (cognitive complexity, cyclomatic complexity, number of lines, etc.)
- Import of [test coverage reports](https://docs.sonarsource.com/sonarqube-cloud/enriching/test-coverage/overview/)
- Import of [external Clippy reports](https://docs.sonarsource.com/sonarqube-cloud/enriching/external-analyzer-reports/)

## Feedback

We welcome your feedback and feature requests to help improve the Rust analyzer. To share your thoughts or request new features, please visit the [Sonar Community Forum](https://community.sonarsource.com/). 

## Building the Project

### Requirements

To work on this project, you will need the following tools:

- Java 17
- Rust 2021
- Gradle
- Cargo

### Build

To build the project, you can use the following Gradle commands:

- `./gradlew tasks`: Lists all the available tasks in the project.
- `./gradlew build`: Compiles the code and runs all tests.
- `./gradlew shadowJar`: Creates a fat JAR file that includes all dependencies.
- `./gradlew spotlessApply`: Formats the code according to the project's style guidelines.

#### Cross-Compilation

The project includes a native Rust analyzer that needs to be cross-compiled for different platforms. To cross-compile the Rust analyzer, 
you need to install cross-compilers and Rust toolchains for the target platforms. Below are the instructions for installing the 
cross-compilers for different platforms:

##### Mac OS X

```shell
brew install SergioBenitez/osxct/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
brew install filosottile/musl-cross/musl-cross
brew install mingw-w64
```

##### Ubuntu

```shell
apt-get -y install rustup gcc-mingw-w64 musl-tools musl-dev build-essential autoconf libtool pkg-config
```

##### Rust Toolchains

You also need to install the Rust toolchains for the target platforms:

```shell
rustup target add x86_64-pc-windows-gnu
rustup target add x86_64-unknown-linux-musl
rustup target add x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
rustup target add aarch64-unknown-linux-musl
rustup target add x86_64-apple-darwin
```

To verify installed toolchains, you can run the following command:

```shell
rustup target list
```

### Running End-to-End Tests

End-to-end tests verify the entire system from start to finish. These tests involve starting a SonarQube instance, invoking the scanner as a user would, running the sensor, sending issues to the Plugin API, processing them using the SonarQube instance, and finally comparing the outcome to the expected behavior.

To run the end-to-end tests, use the following command:

```
./gradlew :e2e:test -Pe2e
```

It executes the end-to-end tests, ensuring that the entire system works as expected.
